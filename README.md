# Huffman_coding
The project is based on the compression of the text files. The code also includes a gui for easy use.
The Huffman coding, helps to compress the text files using the frequency of each character.
THe project takes the input in GUI and then on clicking compress, the file is compressed and the file is also created in the directory.
The compression ratio depends upon the frequency.
The slides includes the attempt to compress the .jpg files but it wasnt efficient at all.
